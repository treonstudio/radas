Before you start, make sure you have a Radas instance configured. If you haven't done that yet, check out the [installation](/docs/installation).

### Mount the handler

We need to mount the handler to SolidStart server. Put the following code in your `*auth.ts` file inside `/routes/api/auth` folder.

```ts title="*auth.ts"
import { auth } from "~/lib/auth";
import { toSolidStartHandler } from "better-auth/solid-start";

export const { GET, POST } = toSolidStartHandler(auth);
```
