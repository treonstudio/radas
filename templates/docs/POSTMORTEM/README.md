# Postmortem

Incidents that could probably affect the end users or just a company are inevitable. Yet
the best thing we can do is to embrace them and learn from them.

A postmortem is a document that describes an incident following by lessons that we have likely learned and actions to prevent the issue from happening again.

The document may contain the root cause, the overall impact that had and the affected areas,
the trigger and the resolution. Moreover, it will contain a detailed timeline of the incidenti for historic reference as well as a list of actions that must be taken to prevent the issue.
